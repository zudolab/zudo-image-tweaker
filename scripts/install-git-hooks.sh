# Install repo-scoped git hooks. Idempotent.

# Called by:
#   - `pnpm install` (via the `prepare` lifecycle script, after lefthook install)
#
# lefthook manages pre-commit (via lefthook.yml). This script installs the
# pre-push worktree guard directly to .git/hooks/pre-push — it is deliberately
# NOT in lefthook.yml because lefthook reads config from the worktree's
# toplevel, so it would silently skip the guard when invoked from inside a
# worktree. Direct install to the shared .git/hooks/ directory ensures the
# guard always fires regardless of where `git push` is called from.
